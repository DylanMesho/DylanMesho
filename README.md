Hi, my name is Dylan Mesho. I'm 13 years old and I am working to become a software engineer, a data scientist, or a game developer. I've been programming since I was 11 (two years now) and I've done a bit of game development, software development, and discord bot development. My other specialty is the piano. I've been playing the piano since I was 9 and I still play to this day. I will most likely be pursuing these talents going forward with my life.
